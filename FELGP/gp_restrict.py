    DUMMY NODE ISSUES

    DEAP will only place terminals if we're at the bottom of a branch.
    This creates two issues:
    1. A primitive that takes other primitives as inputs could be placed at the
        second to last layer.
        SOLUTION: You need to allow the tree to end whenever the height condition is met,
                    so create "dummy" terminals for every type possible in the tree.
    2. A primitive that takes terminals as inputs could be placed above the second to
        last layer.
        SOLUTION: You need to allow the tree to continue extending the branch until the
                    height condition is met, so create "dummy" primitives that just pass
                    through the terminal types.

    These "dummy" terminals and "dummy" primitives introduce unnecessary and sometimes
    nonsensical solutions into populations. These "dummy" nodes can be eliminated
    if the height requirement is relaxed.


    HOW TO PREVENT DUMMY NODE ISSUES

    Relaxing the height requirement:
    When at the bottom of the branch, check for terminals first, then primitives.
        When checking for primitives, skirt the height requirement by adjusting
        the branch depth to be the second to last layer of the tree.
        If neither a terminal or primitive fits this node, then throw an error.
    When not at the bottom of the branch, check for primitives first, then terminals.

    Issue with relaxing the height requirement:
    1. Endless loops are possible when primitive sets have any type loops.
        A primitive with an output of one type may not take an input type of
        itself or a parent type.
        SOLUTION: A primitive set must be well-designed to prevent those type loops.
